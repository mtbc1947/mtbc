            We invite you to come along and give Bowls a try.<br/>
            We will provide the bowls and a member of the club will guide you through the basics of the game.<br/>
            <span className="text-red-600">(We do ask that you wear flat bottom shoes, trainers are fine)</span><br/>
            Have a look around the club, chat to our members and get a feel for the place.<br/>
            Bowls is a great game to play at all ages. You can enjoy it from day one just by playing with other members of the club, but you can take it 
            to County or even National level if you wish.<br/>
            Bowls is also a great way to meet people and we believe the social aspect of the sport to be very important.<br/>
            We would love to see you on. Free Tea/Coffee and biscuits will be available. The bar will be open.<br/>
            So come along and meet us and try your hand at bowls.<br/>
            The Bowls Club is situated in Oaken Grove Recreation Park, car parking is available via the Oaken Grove entrance.
